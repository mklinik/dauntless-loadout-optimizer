Hammer
======

I don't have good KnockoutKing cells, so for now go for Parts damage,
Defense, Stamina

Neutral Parts damage build
--------------------------

- 1 def Fortress
- 1 def Ass. Vigour -- can be changed on the fly for elemental defense
- 1 mob Conditioning
- 1 mob Evasion -- Evasion better for hammer; Agility better for Blades
- 2 pow Sharpened

Fall of the Shrike
Skraevwing Helmet
Shocking Heart
Might of Stone
Hellplate Greaves
Any Lantern
blz:0 fro:0 sho:0 ter:0
pow:2 mob:2 def:2 utl:1
Fortress:2 Conditioning:1 FleetFooted:1 Medic:1

- can have +4 Medic!
- 2 Fortress in perks, can swap Fortress cell for something else later


Umbral survival build
---------------------

- For the Stalker, conditioning is maybe not even that important
- Try to go Medic +4 for the revive speed
- Predator could be interesting
- Valomyr's Burden gives pow,utl so there is not much wiggle room
- Maybe have 2 utl Medi and don't rely on perk

- 1 def Fortress
- 1 def Tough
- 1 mob Evasion
- 1 mob Conditioning
- 1 pow
- 2 utl Medic


Valomyr's Burden
Sight of Stone
Shrikedown Plate
Might of Stone
Lightning Boots
Any Lantern
sho:-1 ter:1
pow:1 mob:2 def:2 utl:2
Tough:1 Fortress:1 Aetherhunter:1 Evasion:1 AethericFrenzy:1


Embermane build
---------------

- Embermane gets staggered a lot.
  - Maybe Overpower? But I don't have good ones.
  - Maybe StunningVigour
- KnockoutKing not useful
- Could use +2 Conditioning from Boreus Hammer, free up one mob
- Winter Squall (Nimble, pow mob)
- Pangar's Rampage (KnockoutKing, pow def)
- Brutality of Boreus (Conditioning, pow def)
- Molten probably not so useful, better for Hellion and Charrogg

- def Fortress
- def Tough
- mob Conditioning
- pow Sharpened
- utl StunningVigour
- tec EvasiveFury


Chain Blades
============

- I have +3 tec Weighted Strikes; could go for stagger build instead of part
  build
- It seems that Chain Blades have more options for tec builds, less options
  for pow builds.

Neutral Part damage build
-------------------------

- 1 def Fortress
- 1 def Ass. Vigour -- can be changed on the fly for elemental defense
- 1 mob Conditioning
- 1 mob Agility     -- Evasion better for hammer; Agility better for Blades
- 2 tec Any good ones -- once I have upgraded Bladestorm, use them!

- Ass. Vigour synergizes with Bladestorm, which I don't have yet

Stormclaw build
---------------

- Mobility and fast attacks, preferrably maxed out shock resist.
- This guy packs a punch
- Question: is it better to have 4 +5 shock equipment or 4 +7 neutral?
  - +5 shock   = 75 + 25 = 100
  - +7 neutral = 95
  - +7 shock   = 95 + 25 = 120 (but only drask ones)

- 1 def Insuplated / Fortress / Iceborne
- 1 def Fortress / Iceborne?
- 1 mob Agility
- 1 mob Conditioning
- 1 tec WeightedStrikes -- synergizes with Skarn's Malice

Ideas
=====

- Fortress and Guardian have good synergy
- Sturdy and Skarn Lantern have good synergy
- Sturdy and Fortress have good synergy

Low-Health build.

- def Iceborne for healing, heals up to 50%
- tec WildFrenzy: increase attack speed when at low health
- Rage: +dmg when under 50% health
  - Charrog argmor has it
  - Boreal armor has it
- def Fortress probably useful
- def Tough useful? It increases max hp


Wound build

- Acidic: increase Wound damage at the cost of Part damage
  - could be useful for Hammer
- Barbed: flat Wound damage
  - useful for Chain Blades, not Hammer
- Savagery: increase damage against wounded parts
