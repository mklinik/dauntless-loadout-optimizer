Chain Blades
============

- I have +3 Weighted Strikes; could go for stagger build instead of part build
- It seems that Chain Blades have more options for tec builds, less options
  for pow builds.

Neutral Part damage build

- 1 def Fortress
- 1 def Ass. Vigour -- can be changed on the fly for elemental defense
- 1 mob Conditioning
- 1 mob Agility     -- Evasion better for hammer; Agility better for Blades
- 2 tec Any good ones -- once I have upgraded Bladestorm, use them!

- Ass. Vigour synergizes with Bladestorm, which I don't have yet

Ideas
=====

- Fortress and Guardian have good synergy

Low-Health build.

- def Iceborne for healing, heals up to 50%
- Some cells that give increased attack power when under 50%
- Wild Frenzy: increase attack speed when at low health (how much?)

Wound build

- Acidic: increase Wound damage at the cost of Part damage
  - could be useful for Hammer
- Barbed: flat Wound damage
  - useful for Chain Blades, not Hammer
- Savagery: increase damage against wounded parts
