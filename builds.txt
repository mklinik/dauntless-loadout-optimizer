Hammer
======

I don't have good KnockoutKing cells, so for now go for Parts damage,
Defense, Stamina

Neutral Parts damage build
--------------------------

- 1 def Fortress
- 1 def Ass. Vigour -- can be changed on the fly for elemental defense
- 1 mob Conditioning
- 1 mob Evasion -- Evasion better for hammer; Agility better for Blades
- 2 pow Sharpened

Fortress:2 Conditioning:1 FleetFooted:1 Medic:1

- can have +4 Medic!
- 2 Fortress in perks, can swap Fortress cell for something else later


Umbral survival build
---------------------

- For the Stalker, conditioning is maybe not even that important
- Try to go Medic +4 for the revive speed
- Predator could be interesting
- Valomyr's Burden gives pow,utl so there is not much wiggle room
- Maybe have 2 utl Medi and don't rely on perk

- 1 def Fortress
- 1 def Tough
- 1 mob Evasion
- 1 mob Conditioning
- 1 pow
- 2 utl Medic

Embermane build
---------------

- Embermane gets staggered a lot.
  - Maybe Overpower? But I don't have good ones.
  - Maybe StunningVigour
- KnockoutKing not useful
- Could use +2 Conditioning from Boreus Hammer, free up one mob
- Winter Squall (Nimble, pow mob)
- Pangar's Rampage (KnockoutKing, pow def)
- Brutality of Boreus (Conditioning, pow def)
- Molten probably not so useful, better for Hellion and Charrogg

No Medic, 2xVigour, 3x def

- can swap fortress for Bloodless if needed
- two free tec is nice
- Predator is nice, AethericAttunement not bad
- Can use Prismatic cells also?
- Electric Cruelties are good weapon. But hard to get I guess.


Neutral Low-Health Build
------------------------

- 2 def Iceborne
- 1 pow Discipline
- 2 tec WildFrenzy (attack speed)
- 2 pow Rage (damage)
- Can we have Conditioning?
- Yes. Fortress would be nice.
- Maybe even better with Prismatic cells?
- What if 2 medic instead of Fortress?
- Question: does +6 Iceborne even need Fortress?
- What about Tough?
- Tough's healing effect applies to lifesteal as well
- So definitely Tough over Fortress
- And is Discipline really needed? How to get below 50% Health then? What about
  healing potions, don't they bring you above 50?
- Doesn't matter, that pow can be used for something else.
- Must be able to get +6 Fireproof for Blaze lava (or maybe different build for that)

Ideas
=====

- Fortress and Guardian have good synergy
- Sturdy and Skarn Lantern have good synergy
- Sturdy and Fortress have good synergy

Low-Health build.

- def Iceborne for healing, heals up to 50%
- tec WildFrenzy: increase attack speed when at low health
- Rage: +dmg when under 50% health
  - Charrog argmor has it
  - Boreal armor has it
- Lady luck has a cell that keeps your health below 50% and increases crit
  chance
- def Fortress probably useful
- def Tough useful? It increases max hp


Wound build

- Acidic: increase Wound damage at the cost of Part damage
  - could be useful for Hammer
- Barbed: flat Wound damage
  - useful for Chain Blades, not Hammer
- Savagery: increase damage against wounded parts
